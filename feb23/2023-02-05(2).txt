a few ideas - by me - 2023-02-05

Every project needs an idea. I have a few integrations, a few requirements, and also a few issues that I may encounter. I will list them here:

IDEAS / INTEGRATIONS:
- STT Recognition
- Personal STT Recognition and Validation (records)
- NFC / RFID Reading for Debug Cards + STT For debug card code
- Arduino Movement Module
- Arduino Multidirection Ultrasonic Sensor Handler
- Light Ambient Sensor (for detecting light in a room)
- Live Camera Device
- Somehow a beefy computer (PySerial + openCV + audioprocess)

ISSUES POTENTIALLY:
- Power Consumption while still being wireless (multiple arduinos, computer)
- Money (this is gonna cost a billion dollars)
- Quick Program (multiple modules will slow down the program)
