in the beginning... there was nothing - by me - 2023-02-05

Well, here we are. It's currently February the Second of 2023. I am sitting in my room, typing this sentence out. I have no materials, I have nothing to do, I have nothing but my own thoughts to accompany me. This project is nothing but an impulse... A random thought that popped into my head. Am I creating this to satisfy myself? Am I creating this to satisfy others? Even I don't know.

For the last probably six months now, I've been bored out of my mind. I've felt every feeling there, as well as felt nothing sometimes. Hopefully this project will help me take my mind off of life. This is pretty much the only thing I CAN do to take my mind off of life. Locking myself in a room and getting lost in my own code usually works. Who knows...

I'm aware that I'm rambling, but I don't care, I have lots that I need to get off my chest. In fact I have way too much that I cannot just fit it all in this measly text document...

May as well just save that for my own journal instead of my "professional" devlog.

As I said before, I have nothing. No materials, Nothing except my own code and a little Arduino simulator. I'm hoping to change that, but I'm a little stripped for cash at the moment..

Oh hey it's 1am now...

Anyways, the vision is for Tally to be someone who can keep me company... I've never really had anyone that I've truly understood, that I can completely trust, that I can actually get along with, without me having to be someone else that I'm not... Sounds stupid that I'm going through all of this just to have a friend.. haha.....

I hate writing this, I need serious help...

I'm gonna end it here...

Ah

Whatever
