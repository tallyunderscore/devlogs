These are all of the logs I will keep during development of Tally. These are for personal reference and not to be used as usage instructions professionally. I usually write all of these while sleep deprived, so excuse my anger and personal rants if those occur. I may forget to log some things, and in that case "me", please write it down somewhere if you can't type, can't afford to miss anything... Anyways enjoy I guess...
